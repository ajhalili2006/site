Traditionally, software release processes are done manually and can be
difficult to integrate into review processes. At Lightspeed, we
created [Palisade](https://github.com/lightspeed/palisade) to solve
this problem. Palisade moves version and release information from
repository metadata into the repository itself so that is easier to
review and approve. Palisade is open-source software released under
the MIT license and can be used by anyone that wants to do version
bumping as a part of their CI processes.

## CHANGELOG.md and VERSION Files

Palisade works by reading two files in the root of your repository:

* A [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) file that
  describes the changes made to the program
* A `VERSION` file that contains the current version of the program
  (ideally following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/))

Every time Palisade is run, it will check the git repository for
version tags based on the contents of the `VERSION` file. If it finds
that the current version has already been tagged, Palisade will do
nothing and exit with the exit code 0. If Palisade finds that there is
a new release, the software will then read the changelog file, scrape
it for release notes, then use those release notes when creating a new
release on GitHub.

As an example, here is a fragment of [Palisade’s
changelog](https://github.com/lightspeed/palisade/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
and the release that was created on GitHub:

```markdown
## 0.4.0

Tag names were incorrectly generated. Before they were the version
numbers, but now they are `v${VERSION}`. This should fix compatibility
issues with Go modules.

An end-to-end test has been fixed as well.
```

This changelog fragment was scraped out and used as the release notes
for [this
release](https://github.com/lightspeed/palisade/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

## Setup

There is more up-to-date detail here, but at a high level you need to
do the following things:

* Set up a CHANGELOG.md file
* Set up a VERSION file
* Commit these files to your repository
* Create a GitHub token with the `repo` permission
* Be sure the user associated with that GitHub token has Maintain
  permissions on the repository
* Add this token to your CI configuration (use secrets when possible)
* Add CI configuration
* Push this all to your repository
* Test a version bump
* Sit back and relax

### Version Bump Flow

To release a new version of a program, first update the version file
to the desired version. Open the `VERSION` file with your favorite
text editor and replace:

```
0.1.0
```

with:

```
0.2.0
```

Then, update the changelog file with the changes in that version. For
example if version `0.2.0` added the ability to interface with clients
using GraphQL, you could add this to your `CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
## 0.2.0

### ADDED

- Exposed GraphQL API for customers and internal integrators

### FIXED

- Solved WAT-2392 which previously prevented users from being able to
  refrobnicate already frobnicated strings when using the secret
  management API.
```

When Palisade runs, it will load the contents of the `VERSION` file
and compare it to the list of git tags in the repo. If that version
tag is not found, then it will create a new GitHub release with the
changelog entry for the new version. Palisade will never re-tag
releases, so it will do nothing if you make a commit without changing
the current version number.

When Palisade processes the above changelog, it would create a release
for tag `v0.2.0` with the following notes:

```markdown
### ADDED

- Exposed GraphQL API for customers and internal integrators

### FIXED

- Solved WAT-2392 which previously prevented users from being able to
  refrobnicate already frobnicated strings when using the secret
  management API.
```

## Architecture

Palisade is written in Rust and uses Nix to build Docker images. Rust
allowed this project to be developed incredibly quickly and Nix makes
the built Docker image as small as possible (16 megabytes or so when
gzipped).

One of the biggest problems that came up during development was the
fact that the existing GitHub API clients were outdated and
insufficient for our needs. Thanks to the hard work done by the team
behind reqwest, it was easy for us to create a minimal wrapper around
the parts of the GitHub API that Palisade requires, and we’ve exposed
it for reuse. If you want to use this library in your Rust projects,
add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```ini
[dependencies.github]
git = "https://github.com/lightspeed/palisade"
```
