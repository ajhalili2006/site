Hey all, I'm speaking at [NixCon North America](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/announcing-first-nixcon-north-america/35874) this year! I'm going to be speaking about the joys of building Docker images with Nix and how Nix is a better Docker image builder than Docker's image builder.

  Docker is everywhere, but Nix is not. Nix lets you build Docker images that
  are easier to deploy than images made with the normal Docker build flow. Want
  to learn how to make images with a 100% build efficiency and turn your
  application deployments from pushing many layers at a time to only pushing
  what actually changed? You can do it with Nix.

This is more of a beginner-focused talk and it's intended to be a bridge into Nix so that you can fit Nix into your existing flows more easily instead of burning down everything and starting over from scratch. Docker images have become the de-facto package format for the Internet, so letting you fit Nix into the equation means that you can gradually experiment on things.

If you're interested in seeing my talk, make sure to head to [SCALE 21x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x) in Pasadena, California on March 14-17, 2024 at the Pasadena Convention Center. I'll have some goodies to give out!
