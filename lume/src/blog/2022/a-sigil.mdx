The upper left-hand corner of my website has gotten more interesting as of
recently. I have decided to experiment with adding an SVG icon to the upper left
hand corner of the page.

This is the sigilized form of the name `Xe Iaso`. This sigil is equivalent in
meaning and semantics to the name `Xe Iaso`. It's in the upper-left hand corner of every page on the site.

<XeblogConv name="Mara" mood="hacker">
  Fun fact: the sigil is written using{" "}
  <a href="https://greggshorthand.github.io/index.html">Gregg Shorthand</a>. It
  says the phonetic equivalent of `Xe Iaso`.
</XeblogConv>

I have tested this in Edge on Linux, Firefox on Linux, Chrome on Android and
Safari on iOS. This should cover most of the big web browsers, but surely I've
missed something. If you use a _modern release_ of a _standards compliant_ web
browser and you don't see a logo anywhere on the page, please let me know so I
can go cry and then hopefully fix the issue.
