For this stream I talked about the game [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://zelda.nintendo.com/breath-of-the-wild/) and how it has impacted me over the last 7 years of my life. This stream was released in the lead-up to [The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom](https://zelda.nintendo.com/tears-of-the-kingdom/), so a lot of it will be talking about what I think will happen in that game.
