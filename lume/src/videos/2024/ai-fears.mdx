I have been having some difficulty with motivation for creating things lately, and not because of writer's block or anything like that. I've actually been having difficulty with motivation because of the fact that whatever I make, it will just be the input to a system that will replace me. Or at least the input to a system that will be able to 80/20 the things that I do. And I don't know how to feel about this.

Per hour, I cost a fair bit of money, and I need to sleep at night. I need to take vacations. I can burn out. I can get sick. I have medical leave.

A large language model doesn't need to do any of that. AI tools don't have those problems. They
go 24/7. They never have to sleep. They don't get RSI. They don't burn out. They don't take vacations. They just continue doing the thing that they're set up to do until the computer shuts off.

I don't know how to feel about it.
