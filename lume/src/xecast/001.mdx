- Xe reveals their desire to write a book and create short films based on the Techaro universe.

**Key Takeaways:**

- **Embracing the Cursed:** Xe's passion for technology lies in its potential for unconventional and even "cursed" solutions. This approach has fueled their career and creative pursuits.
- **Relatability in Fiction:** Xe's Techaro series thrives on its generic, relatable depiction of the tech industry. By avoiding specific details, readers can easily draw parallels to real-world companies and experiences.
- **Technology as a Mirror:** Xe believes technology amplifies existing human flaws and societal issues. They use their writing to explore this concept, drawing inspiration from shows like "The Twilight Zone" and "Black Mirror."
- **AI as a Narrative Tool:** Xe sees AI as a powerful tool for social commentary, particularly regarding labor exploitation. They plan to explore this theme in future Techaro stories.
