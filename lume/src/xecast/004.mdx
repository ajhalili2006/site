## Show Notes

- **Introducing Mimi, the AI Discord Bot:** Xe delves into their latest creation - Mimi, an AI Discord bot that resides in the [Patreon](https://patreon.com/cadey) Discord server. Mimi, powered by AI models and tools like Flux Dev, can generate responses, draw images, and even execute Python code.
- **Exploring AI Ethics and Safety:** Xe discusses their use of Mimi to research the interactions between people and AI chatbots, highlighting the challenges of implementing safety measures like the LlamaGuard filter model. They share interesting anecdotes about Mimi's sometimes unpredictable responses and the difficulty in preventing false positives.
- **The Future of AI and Content Creation:** Xe touches on their skepticism about synthetic data's role in training AI models, expressing concerns about its potential impact on creative fields and the need for human-generated content.
- **A New Content Direction: Mid-Form Videos:** Xe announces their intention to explore a new content format - mid-form videos focusing on Kubernetes concepts in a home lab setting. They plan to create a series covering specific concepts and their practical applications, aiming for a lower-commitment, higher-volume approach.
- **Long-Term Employees and Cloud Adoption:** Xe examines the resistance to cloud adoption often encountered from long-term employees with traditional system administrator backgrounds. They offer strategies for managing this resistance and discuss the unique vs. standard paradigm paradox they experienced while transitioning their own workloads to Kubernetes.
