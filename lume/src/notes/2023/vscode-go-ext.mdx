When I write these articles, I like having an answer to the question at hand before I start writing. I don't feel like it is fair to readers to have a question without an answer.

This isn't a normal article. This is a cry for help. I don't know how to google for this and tools of last resort are failing me.

I use VSCode on my macbook and gaming PC. Both have extension syncing enabled to make my life easier. The [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go) keeps randomly getting uninstalled on every machine. I have no idea why it does this. I have no idea how to stop it from doing this. I have no idea how to debug it.

What the fuck am I doing wrong?

Here are all of the steps I've tried:

- Removing settings sync and re-enabling it on all affected machines
- Looking through system logs around the time of the removal happening
- Starting from scratch on a new machine (my new work computer) and then syncing settings to find that the Go extension is not being synced
- Marking the Go extension as "do not sync" and then marking it as "do sync"

If anyone is able to figure out what I could have possibly fucked up, I will post the solution here and credit them.

I hope it's something really stupid.
