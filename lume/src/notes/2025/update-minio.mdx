Recent [AWS SDK changes](https://www.tigrisdata.com/blog/downgrade-py-js/) have broken many non-S3 object stores. MinIO has released [RELEASE.2025-01-20T14-49-07Z](https://github.com/minio/minio/releases/tag/RELEASE.2025-01-20T14-49-07Z) that fixes compatibility with these new SDK versions.

If you do not update your MinIO instance, you will get error messages like this when using the AWS CLI, boto3, SDK for JavaScript, SDK for Java, or SDK for PHP:

```
upload failed: ./pvc.yaml to s3://radical/pvc.yaml An error occurred (MissingContentLength) when calling the PutObject operation: You must provide the Content-Length HTTP header.
```

Good luck!
