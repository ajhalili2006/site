Hey all. Last year in November, I joined [Fly.io](https://fly.io) to help create the Developer Relations (DevRel) team. I wasn't very loud about it at the time, but I'm excited to announce that I'm looking for people to join me on the team! If you're interested in helping developers build and deploy their apps, this might be the role for you.

  The pithy thing to say here would be "Uber for Heroku" or something, but that
  really sells Fly.io short.

Fly.io is a public cloud that makes it easy to run your applications close to your users. I've been a Fly.io user [since I deployed XeDN](/blog/xedn/) and honestly, it's been the most magical deployment experience I've had since I started experimenting with Heroku's free tier in high school. I've been [an advocate for Fly.io](/blog/fly.io-heroku-replacement/) since before I was an employee, and I'm excited to be able to help other developers get the same experience I've had.

This job is something close to 20% dev and 80% rel. There's an internal team that is more focused on the developer side of things and we're mostly focused on the relations to developers outside of language/framework-specific communities. We want to break past the Hacker News demographic and get closer to the mainstream. We're looking for people who are excited about helping developers succeed and people who want to help us build a team that is focused on that. If developers succeed, we all succeed.

Here's a run-down of what the last few months have been like for me:

- November: I joined Fly.io and started working with others to define what DevRel really is and started gaining expertise with the [GPU](https://fly.io/blog/gpu-ga/) side of the product. I also started having interviews with customers and have been working on a few blog posts.
- December: Interviewed a few more people and wrote a few more blog posts. I also started working on a few more projects that I can't talk about yet.
- January: Published the things that carried over from December and planned travel for [NixCon NA](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/21x/nixcon-us) to talk about building Docker images with Nix. I also started working on [GPU benchmarking](https://community.fly.io/t/gpu-benchmarking/17729) in public, building up some knowledge about Machine patterns in the process.
- February: Speaking at the Ollama meetup in San Francisco and meeting with a16z people about AI/ML and GPU stuff. Splitting up the GPU benchmarking discoveries into a few corp blog posts (one of them is about userspace networking!).
