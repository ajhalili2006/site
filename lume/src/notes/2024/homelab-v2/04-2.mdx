This is a followup to [my last post](../04/), where I was trying to get Longhorn working on my cluster. Turns out the problem was really stupid and I need to explain what's going on so you can properly commiserate.

Talos Linux sets a default security policy that blocks the Longhorn manager from running. This is because the Longhorn manager runs as root and Talos Linux is paranoid about security. In order to get Longhorn running, I had to add the following annotations to the Longhorn namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: longhorn-system
  labels:
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce: privileged
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce-version: latest
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit: privileged
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/audit-version: latest
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn: privileged
    pod-security.kubernetes.io/warn-version: latest
```

Then you can create a PersistentVolumeClaim and attach it to a pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: longhorn-volv-pvc
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: longhorn
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-test
  namespace: default
spec:
  restartPolicy: Always
  containers:
    - name: volume-test
      image: nginx:stable-alpine
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      livenessProbe:
        exec:
          command:
            - ls
            - /data/lost+found
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 5
      volumeMounts:
        - name: volv
          mountPath: /data
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
  volumes:
    - name: volv
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: longhorn-volv-pvc
```

  I feel so dumb right now. It was just a security policy mismatch.
