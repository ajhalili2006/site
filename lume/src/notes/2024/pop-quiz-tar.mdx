Pop quiz: what is wrong with this tar command?

```sh
tar cf ../iosevka-iaso.tgz .
```

<Conv name="Aoi" mood="wut">
  That looks fine to me? You're creating a tarball in the parent directory with
  the contents of the current working directory. What's the problem?
</Conv>

```sh
$ tar xzf iosevka-iaso.tgz
gzip: not a compressed stream
```

The thing I messed up was not adding `z` to the tarball creation command. I needed to do:

```sh
tar czf ../iosevka-iaso.tgz .
```

This happens because GNU tar looks at file extensions to try to determine the user's intent. If you do `tar xf foo.tgz` or `tar xf foo.tar.gz`, it will invoke gzip to decompress the tarball for you. This is intended behavior, but that same logic doesn't run when you create a tarball.

I lost 15 minutes to this today and feel that I need to let y'all know so you can learn from my suffering.
