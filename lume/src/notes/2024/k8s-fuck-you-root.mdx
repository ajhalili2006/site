title: "How to make a Kubernetes debug pod that is actually root"

tl;dr: `--profile=sysadmin`

Let's say you have a k8s cluster but running on a distro without SSH and god is dead requiring you to interactively debug the machine with a shell session. [Wonder why you'd want to do that](/blog/2024/k8s-irc-client/).

`kubectl debug node/whatever` lets you get a pod that is kinda root, but you end up getting permissions issues when you try to do something exciting like format a disk. This is because you need the `--profile=sysadmin` flag to curse the pod with super-god powers. You also need to run these super-god pods in the `kube-system` namespace. Here's the command you want for the node `pneuma` (replace your node name here):

```
$ kubectl debug node/pneuma -it --image=ubuntu -n kube-system --profile=sysadmin
```

This gets you a super-god pod running ubuntu (or any other image you want).

Happy Kubesing!
