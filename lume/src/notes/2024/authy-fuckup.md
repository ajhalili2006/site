EDIT: I got access back. Merging accounts apparently takes an hour without it telling you that it does. Crisis averted. Still moving away from Authy because that experience was terrifying.

~~I tried to move my Authy config to a new phone and somehow managed to get Authy to nuke all of my 2fa secrets from the face of the earth. If you work at Twilio or know someone that works at Twilio, please [contact me](/contact/) so that I can get my accounts back.~~

~~And so that I can migrate away from using Authy since apparently it's a time bomb waiting to happen.~~
