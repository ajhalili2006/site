A recent update to Dolphin made it switch to QT6. This makes it crash with this error or something like it:

```
dolphin-emu: symbol lookup error: dolphin-emu: undefined symbol: _Zls6QDebugRK11QDockWidget, version Qt_6
```

This is fixed by running this command in SteamOS:

```
flatpak update --commit=44bfa315a0cf9c94a97dfe61127dc05e0e8c85c5c7559dc7665529ec1aa7a3ee org.DolphinEmu.dolphin-emu
```

This will downgrade Dolphin so things work again.
