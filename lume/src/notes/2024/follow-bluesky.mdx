Hey all!

I'm not going to be posting as much on Twitter/X anymore. I've moved a lot of my online posting to [Bluesky](https://bsky.social). If you want to follow me there, follow [@xeiaso.net](https://bsky.app/profile/xeiaso.net). You can also follow me on Bluesky via the Fediverse with [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) at [@xeiaso.net@bsky.brid.gy](https://fed.brid.gy/bsky/xeiaso.net).

I've locked my Twitter account and will not be posting anything there but reminders that I have left. Thank you for following me there all these years, but enough has become enough and I have no real reason to stay there. Bluesky is just a better place for me.

Stay safe out there and have fun on the internets!
