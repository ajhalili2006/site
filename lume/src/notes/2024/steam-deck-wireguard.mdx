While I was poking around SteamOS, I tried to run wg-quick and was surprised to see it was preinstalled. I've been wanting to get into my Deck from my MacBook over a stable IP for a fair bit, and this means I can just add it to my private [fly.io](https://fly.io) network.

So I did that:

```
$ fly wg create personal yul mipha mipha.conf
```

And then I imported the config to my deck over normal SSH and activated it:

```
$ sudo cp mipha.conf /etc/wg-quick/fly0.conf

$ sudo systemctl enable --now wg-quick@fly0.service
```

And then I can ping it as normal:

```
$ ping6 fdaa:0:641b:a7b:9285:0:a:2502 -c4

Et voila! I'm in. Now it's easy to copy off the videos I got with Decky Recorder. Here's a few screenshots I've copied over:

Hope this gives you ideas!
