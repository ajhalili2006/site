While evaluating [RushOrderTees](https://www.rushordertees.com/) for a previous employer, an embarrassing security vulnerability was discovered. User accounts created inside their t-shirt designer do not have a password attached to them, allowing anyone to authenticate with only an email address. This allows disclosure of at least this information:

- Full name on any orders
- Any custom designs
- Order id numbers
- Phone numbers when placing new orders

This was proven by attempting to log into a RushOrderTees company account using a publicly visible email address.

## Replication

RushOrderTees has not acknowledged this issue and it is still trivial to reproduce it today:

1. Create a new design
2. Attempt to purchase it
3. Save it with a custom name
4. Enter in your email address

You have now created a RushOrderTees account _without a password attached_.

## Explanation

This lapse in security is understandable from a customer acquisition standpoint (every barrier in the way of users paying makes you lose half of your potential customer base), but is fairly inexcusable in 2024. Additionally, by making user accounts only protected with email addresses (public identifiers), this bypasses the entire point of authentication. It is difficult to figure out if this is a design choice or a security issue.
