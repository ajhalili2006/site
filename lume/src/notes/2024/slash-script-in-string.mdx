When I was implementing [this change](https://github.com/Xe/site/commit/944fbf678403c77e158accd66363accbbe6d6eb4) in my site, I ran into a weird issue where my literal JavaScript text was being inserted into the page as if it was in the literal HTML. This was odd at first, but then I realized what was going on.

I was converting code that looked like this:

```html
<script src="https://ethical-ads.whatever/script.js" async></script>
<div
  data-ea-publisher="christinewebsite"
  data-ea-type="text"
  data-ea-style="fixedfooter"
></div>
```

Into something like this:

```html
<script>
    if (!window.location.hostname.includes(".shark-harmonic.ts.net")) {
        document.write('<script src="https://ethical-ads.whatever/script.js" async></script>');
    }
</script>
<div data-ea-publisher="christinewebsite" data-ea-type="text" data-ea-style="fixedfooter"></div>
```

But then I saw `'); }` at the top of every page. This was odd, but when I figured out what was going on, I felt very dumb. I was writing a string that contained a `</script>` tag, which was causing the browser to think that the script tag was ending early.

The fix was simple: escape the `</script>` tag in the string. This is done by replacing the `/` with `\/`:

```html
<script>
  if (!window.location.hostname.includes(".shark-harmonic.ts.net")) {
    document.write(
      '<script src="https://ethical-ads.whatever/script.js" async><\/script>'
    );
  }
</script>
<div
  data-ea-publisher="christinewebsite"
  data-ea-type="text"
  data-ea-style="fixedfooter"
></div>
```
